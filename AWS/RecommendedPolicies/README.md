# IAM Policies for use in an IAM Role for ParkMyCloud Cross-Account Access

Here are some example policies you can use to grant **ParkMyCloud** the minimum permissions necessary to manage your AWS resources.

See our [User Guide](https://parkmycloud.atlassian.net/wiki/x/BYCMAg) for a more detailed description of these various policies.

## PMC-AWS-Policy.json and PMCRecommendedAWSPolicy.json

These files are identical in content but have two different names for backwards compatibility with some external scripts.  The policy provides the core functionality for the ParkMyCloud service.

## PMC-AWS-Policy-with-tagging.json

Same permissions as the base recommended policy, but requires a tag on certain resources in order to allow start/stop action.  Good for AWS accounts that contain a mixture of  Dev/Test/Production resources. Note that not all "write" permissions can be limited by tag.

## PMC-AWS-Policy-simple.json

Most of the core functionality of the recommended policy, but laid out in the simplest fashion possible.

## PMC-AWS-Policy-read-only.json

Policy that does not allow ParkMyCloud to modify any part of your environment.

## PMCRecommendedAWSGovCloudPolicy.json

Jult like `PMCRecommendedAWSPolicy.json`, except it does not have permissions for services not yet supported in GovCloud.
